      <p>Thank you for visiting our page! In this application we use what we learned
        in React & MongoDB to demonstrate an example of a theme park webpage. On our
        webpage we have 3 different parks with a variety of different rides. Feel free
        to browse around & add your favorite rides :)</p>
